Clara's current work focus is the areas of intervention which support sustainable
development across civic capital, inclusive economies and the zero carbon economy.

She co-authored Future Planners [Demos] and Sustaining our Suburbs [RICS / CABE]
and is currently working on phase two of the Suburban project. She is also exploring
the role of civic institutions in the 21st century to support culture change in
geographic and networked communities and has been developing a Blueprint document
for The Hub which explores the infrastructures [physical, social, operational and financial] to support small ethical business in the new economy. She has specialisms in business development including organisational structure and practice, capital and revenue funding systems, do-it-yourself models of community-led sustainable development and the new project delivery tools and processes to support this.

She is [@ClaraFM][] on Twitter.
