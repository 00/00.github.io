He is a visiting tutor and lecturer at various UK Universities and has attended and spoken on ecological design at conferences and colleges in both UK and Europe. In 2009, with a colleague from FCBS, he visited The Gobabeb Training and Research Centre in the Namib desert in Namibia with a view to developing a masterplan and designs for new buildings for the indigenous communities which utilise local climate conditions, materials and ecology and appropriate technologies to provide a sustainable development in an extreme arid location.
