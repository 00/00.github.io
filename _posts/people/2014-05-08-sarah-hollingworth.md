Sarah has expertise in both architectural design and research, specialising in education, community and co-design projects. She has experience of working on education projects from large-scale higher-education with de Blacam and Meagher Architects in Ireland, award winning Cork Institute of Technology and St Angela's College, Sligo, to co-design with primary and secondary schools in Sheffield and London, such as the designing, testing and critiquing of participation approaches with under 5s at Hunter's Bar Primary School, Sheffield.

Sarah's research projects focus on the inhabitant's perception and use of space, for example, Domestic Diaspora, an investigation into the affect of the spatial principles of English housing on immigrant occupants. The study developed a toolkit for consultation that overcomes language barriers. Sarah is passionate about the representation of users, especially the marginal, to deliver responsive and responsible architectural. Currently, she is running SOAR Work, a project to deliver a community enterprise centre for a community regeneration partnership in North Sheffield.

Sarah was nominated for the RIBA Silver medal in 2007 and has tutored at the University of Sheffield and ran the Tower Hamlets Summer University course 'Getting into Architecture' that aims to broaden diversity in the architectural profession.
