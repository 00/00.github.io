title: Protocols
intro: "Our operating protocols are:"
---

1. **Entrepreneurial subsidiarity**: opportunities are to be handled by the
   smallest, lowest, or least centralised authority capable (1+1.1).
1. **Open Governance and radical transparency**: apply the principles of radical
   transparency and openness to every aspect of how we behave, operate, record
   and transact -- from decision-making and procurement to strategy.
1. **A Network in becoming**: we are an emerging network that is in a constant
   dynamic state of experimenting, re-making and evolving. All members are
   required to uphold their obligation to honour, evolve and advance the
   potential of 00, regardless of historical legacy or incumbency.
4. **An open & fair market**: we operate a fair price policy, as developed
   and openly agreed through dialogue and participation, which provides fair pay
   to producers and can also be sustained by the market. We will all take into
   account, when agreeing or accepting remuneration, the pay-range across the
   entire ecosystem to ensure a fair distribution of pay from highest to lowest
   and avoid large disparity within the ecosystem.
5. **A mutually supportive, beneficial & permissive culture**: all members will
   openly credit others, share opportunities, assets & IP. We participate actively
   to support one another across the network as a whole. This includes actively
   seeking opportunities to further the intellectual and creative development of
   individual members, and also recognising and promoting achievements.
6. **Active Contribution**: members should attend events whenever reasonably
   possible, keep your online profile up to date and are responsive to requests
   from other members in a timely and constructive manner. All members communicate
   frequently and effectively with team members and the network, to increase the
   levels of shared responsibility and active learning.
7. **Shared responsibility**: we aspire to live up to these protocols and
   principles and hold each other accountable in a collaborative and supportive
   manner. All members act in a trustworthy manner, demonstrating integrity and
   honesty, making firm commitments and honouring them.
8. **Learning ecosystem**: we aspire to creating frameworks of learning and sharing
   within 00 and the wider global network.
9. **Minimal management**: we aspire towards a zero top-down management model.
